CO<sub>2</sub> geological storage is a carbon capture and storage technology that captures CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from fixed sources like power plants and stores it in underground saline formations, making it a practical and near-term solution. However, long-term monitoring is necessary to ensure volume storage integrity. Time-lapse gravity monitoring is an effective low-cost and minimally invasive technique for monitoring geological storage sites. To predict subsurface CO<sub>2</sub> plumes, a deep learning approach was developed that outperforms traditional inversion methods, producing high-resolution 3D subsurface reconstructions in near real-time. The figure above highlights the results of two of our proposed approaches. More details and results can be found [here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10115500/).
